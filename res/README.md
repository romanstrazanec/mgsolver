# Resource file directory

**DO NOT REMOVE, RENAME OR MANIPULATE WITH THIS DIRECTORY!**

## Instructions

This directory should contain 'top.csv' AND 'left.csv' files.
Each of them represents nonogram configuration and is written by numbers separated by comma.

Left.csv contains numbers on the left side of the nonogram and is written as it is.
Top.csv contains numbers on the top side of the nonogram, but:

- lines represent columns; from top to the bottom line meaning from left to the right column
- numbers in lines are ordered left to right meaning from bottom number to the top one

Hint: *rotate nonogram 90 degrees to the right and rewrite the numbers as they are*.
